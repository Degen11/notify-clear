# Badge Buster

Badge Buster is a UX concept exploring the idea of clearing notification badges and reducing interface noise.

## How It Works

Badge Buster is built around a simple idea: clearing every notification badge across your phone.

In practice, modern mobile operating systems prevent apps from modifying notifications or badges belonging to other apps.

## What It Won’t Do

Mobile operating systems sandbox apps for security and privacy.

This means Badge Buster cannot reset badges or notifications from other apps like Messages, WhatsApp, Instagram, or Mail.

If badges persist, they must be cleared directly within those apps or adjusted through your device’s notification settings.

## About

Badge Buster is a UX concept exploring notification reset, attention management, and digital decluttering.

While platform restrictions prevent global badge control, the project reflects a common user frustration: persistent interface noise.
