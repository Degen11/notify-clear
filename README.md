# Badge Buster

A UX concept exploring the idea of clearing every notification badge on your phone with a single tap.

## What is this?

Badge Buster is a design concept, not a shipping product. iOS and Android sandbox apps for security and privacy, so no app can actually reach into other apps and clear their badges. This project visualizes what that experience *could* feel like if that restriction didn't exist.

## Live Demo

[badge-buster.vercel.app](https://badge-buster.vercel.app)

## Running Locally

It's a single HTML file. Open `index.html` in your browser or serve it however you want:

```bash
npx serve .
```

## Why?

Badge fatigue is real. Those little red circles are engineered to pull you back into apps, and most of the time they're noise. This is a nod to the shared desire for a calmer phone experience.
